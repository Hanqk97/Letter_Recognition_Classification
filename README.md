# Environment Requirement
To run the ipynb files, you need to have the python 3.9 version (Recommend 3.9.12). Due to the update of python 3.10, running the code on python 3.10 will cause several errors. 
Following packages are needed: NumPy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, random
Recommend using vscode to run the code.
# Report 
There are two report files ([Report.md](https://github.com/Hanqk97/Letter_Recognition_Classification/blob/main/Report.md) and [Report.pdf](https://github.com/Hanqk97/Letter_Recognition_Classification/blob/main/Report.pdf)). The original report is written on Report.md and Report.pdf is transformed from it which causes more blank than before due to graph format. Recommend reading Report.md if allowed.
# Code
All the code in the [classification.ipynb](https://github.com/Hanqk97/Letter_Recognition_Classification/blob/main/Classification.ipynb) file. In the file have instructions for each part of the code and its function.
